            <p>My name is Waleed Younes, and I was born in Surrey, B.C. I grew up always loving computers
                and what kind of programs it had to offer. My parents used to tell me that "You <em>have</em> to become
                a
                lawyer",
                and that is what I was originally pushing towards until I realized to my self; <strong>"Your life, your
                    decision".</strong>
                So I began taking Computer Science in High School and I reassured myself that computing is the path I
                want
                to take.
                My journey starts here.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Waleed Younes, and I was born in Surrey, B.C. I grew up always loving computers
            and what kind of programs it had to offer. My parents used to tell me that "You <em>have</em> to become a lawyer",
            and that is what I was originally pushing towards until I realized to my self; <strong>"Your life, your decision".</strong>
            So I began taking Computer Science in High School and I reassured myself that computing is the path I want to take.
            My journey starts here.
